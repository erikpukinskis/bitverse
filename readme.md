# BitVerse

A distributed interactive world.

### Overview

Here's a guess. The two things holding us back from having a true virtual public 
commons, a la Snowcrash, are:

1. We don't have a decentralized game world.
2. The game worlds out there aren't seeded with artists and organizers.

BitVerse is an attempt to correct both, in that order.

### Interaction

Eventually, players should be able to create and participated in fully interactive 
spaces, but the first prototype will just be a fixed world for editing. A distributed
sculpture, if you will.

#### Actions

Users need to be able to:

*Allocate addresses* - This just involves signing a request for space and getting a
key back from the network. Then you can build an entire world in that infinite space.
This contrasts to SecondLife where there is a fixed geography.  In BitVerse, you
could put a copy of Times Square in your bedroom, with Mt. Everest out the window.

*Create matter* - Base address, X,Y,Z and color. For now I am thinking opaque voxels,
for simplicity's sake. Move, and destroy would also be on the table.

*Link* - Would either create a portal, or a kind of crystal ball-like link.  So, 
either a doorway to Times Square, or a copy of Times Square in your back yard.
